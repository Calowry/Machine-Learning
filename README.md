The machine learning team is responsible for collecting data about the different classes of food used in the model, as well as the dataset used in training the model. The machine learning team is also responsible for building the architecture of the model by utilizing pre-trained InceptionV3 weights and adding a unique dense layer at the end to serve as the classifier. The machine learning team was also able to convert the model into TFLite form in order to be deployed to Android.
Our model is able to distinguish 22 different classes of food with more than 97% confidence.
